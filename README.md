# Spiking_NN_RGB_FPGA
FPGA Design of a Spiking Neural Network


This project presents design and FPGA implementation of a spiking neural network (SNN). It is based on project NN_RGB_FPGA and both implementations can be compared to understand the concept of an SNN. Video lectures explain training of the network and VHDL implementation. Real FPGA hardware is available as a remote lab. 

The application is color detection in video signals. The code is intended as an educational example.

The FPGA Vision Remote Lab is Open Education.
